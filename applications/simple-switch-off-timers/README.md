### Simple Switch Off TImers

This application provides a simple switch timeout system for turning off 
switches that have been left on. Sometimes people refer to this as an
"Egg Timer".

This isn't anything you cannot accomplish with Rule Machine, but it's a lot
easier to manage, especially if you have dozens of them.
