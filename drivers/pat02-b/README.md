### Philio PAT02-B Temperature / Humidity sensor

This driver supports the PAT02-B Temperature / Humidity sensor made by Philio

Philio devices appear to be sold under several different names. Ones that I know of are Philio, Zipato, and Safe Grow. There are probably others as well.

Note that this driver supports the PAT02-B (Temperature / Humidity) only. It does not support the PAT02-A (Flood / Temperature / Humidity) or the PAT02-C (Flood only) devices. I expect that adding support for the flood sensor in the PAT02-A would be trivial, but I do not have one of these devices to test with. If you have one, and are interested in adding support to the driver, please let me know.
