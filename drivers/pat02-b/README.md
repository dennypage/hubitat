### Philio PAT02-B Temperature / Humidity sensor

This driver supports the PAT02-B Temperature / Humidity sensor made by Philio

Philio devices appear to be sold under several different names. Ones that I know of are Philio, Zipato, and Safe Grow. There are probably others as well.

Note that this driver supports the PAT02-B (Temperature / Humidity) only. There is now a generic PAT02 driver (also in this repository) that supports all PAT02-A/B/C (Flood / Temperature / Humidity) devices.
